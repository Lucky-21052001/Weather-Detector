Weather Detector - It's a weather application

 My Weather application is a user-friendly and informative website that allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecasts for any location worldwide.
 Built using React and integrated with the OpenWeather API, the application provides real-time weather data for cities across the globe.
 Users can simply enter a city name or coordinates in the search bar, and the application fetches accurate weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. 
 The intuitive design and responsive layout ensure a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. To enhance performance, we implemented data caching to reduce API calls, making the application faster and more efficient.
 Additionally, we prioritized security by handling API keys securely and utilizing HTTPS to encrypt data transmission.
 My weather application  helps users stay updated on the weather in their current location .
